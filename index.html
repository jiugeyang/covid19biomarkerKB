            Biomarker is a biological molecule that signals healthy versus disease conditions in the body. It is also called as a molecular marker or signature molecule. It is easily detectable and measurable. It can be even used as a marker for treatment evaluation. The molecule can be a gene, protein, or metabolite. The Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools (BEST) glossary developed by the FDA-NIH Joint Leadership Council defines a biomarker as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions. The biomarkers differ from clinical assessments and have distinct functions in biomedical research, clinical practice, and medical product development. Biomarkers have a wide range of applications depending on their usage in different stages of the disease. In the face of COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers are exploring are roles of various biomarkers in COVID-19. Several recent publications are investigating the potential use of existing biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. We are trying to help researchers who are working on developing diagnostics or drugs by organizing biomarker data from publications into a standardized table. This is a 6 week COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase crowd-sourced project where anyone with a biology background can participate.

           Project Goal</h2>
         <p style= "font-family: sans-serif;">
            To create a COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase that will assist researchers working on the development of diagnostics or drugs by organizing biomarker data from publications into a standardized table.
