        <h1>BEST Biomarkers</h1>

        <h2>Susceptibility/risk biomarkers</h2>
        
        <p>Indicate the potential ability of an individual to develop a disease or a medical condition, who currently does not have a clinically evident disease or a disorder. For instance, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level may be used as a susceptibility/risk biomarker to identify the risk of COVID-19 aggravation. Pre-existing conditions and biological age of an individual are being identified as susceptibility/risk biomarkers.</p>
        
        <h2>Diagnostic biomarkers</h2>
        
        <p>Identify or confirm the existence of a disease or condition of interest, or to recognize individuals with the disease subtype. For example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid is the leading diagnostic marker for COVID-19. This biomarker is being tested by Real-Time PCR or Rapid immunochromatography tests (antigen-based detection / antibody-based detection) or Serological tests in the blood (IgM and IgG).</p>
        
        <h2>Monitoring biomarkers</h2>
        
        <p>Access the status of the disease or medical condition on the exposure of or effect of a medical substance or an environmental agent. In the case of COVID-19, various markers levels such as IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), Ferritin, KL-6, cardiac troponin values (hs-cTnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are often seen to be dysregulated in COVID-19 patients.</p>
        
        <h2>Prognostic biomarkers</h2>
        
        <p>Identify the probability of a clinical occurrence, recurrence of disease, or worsening in patients with an unusual illness or medical condition. For instance, CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, and D-dimer are independent prognostic markers of disease severity in COVID-19 patients.</p>
        
        <h2>Predictive biomarkers</h2>
        
        <p>Classify individuals who are more likely to experience a favorable or unfavorable effect from exposure to a medicinal product or an environmental agent than similar individuals without the biomarker. In the case of COVID-19, ICU admission may be predicted by elevations in leukocyte count and levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and LDH.</p>
        
        <h2>Pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers</h2>
        
        <p>Demonstrate that a biological response has occurred in an individual exposed to a medicinal product or to an environmental agent. For example, CYP450 and CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions are being examined as pharmacodynamic biomarkers.</p>
        
        <h2>Safety biomarkers</h2>
        
        <p>measure the probability, occurrence, or degree of an adverse effect of toxicity on exposure to a medicinal product or an environmental agent. For instance, Chloroquines used to treat COVID-19 patients show clinically apparent liver injury and increase levels of serum aminotransferases.</p>
